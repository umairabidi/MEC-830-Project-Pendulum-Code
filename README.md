# MEC 830 Project Pendulum Code
 
This is the project directory for my Inverted Pendulum project.

Directories:
MATLAB Simulation Rotary has the MATLAB Simulink files for the Simscape model.
Obsolete contains the code for the encoder and some other code that was not used in the final design.
It also has the old simulation of the linear slider model.
RotaryPendulum_Test1 has working code for only P control. This file was preserved because it has the main organization for the final program and remains as a fallback file.
RotaryPendulum contains RotaryPendulum.ino which is the arduino code that is responsible for balancing the pendulum. This is the finalized code.
